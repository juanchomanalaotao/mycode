The code is good, especially the object-oriented programming I was amazed at what was inside this method. 
I think every line of this code was not difficult to understand and had any conflict.
As a programmer and experience,  I learn how to read and how it functions and in this code, was easy to know what it was for. 
For the push notifications "onesignal" I dont know how to use it because I can't see the broadcast and the events
As of now I only use "PUSHER" for laravel and the socket io but I see a lot of static codes.
and for the pushing array I use array_push(variable,value) instead of this [].
and also the "foreach" in laravel I use map method to filter of what I need. Example, the ID's.
